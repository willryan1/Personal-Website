	<p>Like privately owned corporations, foreign state-owned entities often become
	entangled in litigation in United States courts. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities
	Act (FSIA) established certain limits on the extent of such litigation
	by granting foreign states the presumption of immunity from suit in U.S.
	courts. The FSIA's protection extends somewhat broadly, including within its
	coverage foreign states proper, as well as the "agencies or instrumentalities" of
	foreign states. Determining precisely what constitutes an agency or instrumentality,
	however, is a difficult process. As U.S. plaintiffs seek to sue foreign stateowned
	corporations, one vexing yet unresolved question is becoming increasingly
	important and contentious: whether a corporation owned by an agency or
	instrumentality of a foreign state is itself part of the foreign state for purposes of
	the FSIA.</p>
	<p>This question centers on so-called "tiered corporations," those with multiple
	layers of corporate ownership, in which intermediate corporations buffer a
	corporate entity from its ultimate owner-in this context, a foreign state. 
	While the contours of tiered corporations vary, a typical corporate structure is
	illustrated in Gardiner Stone Hunter Int'l. v. Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espafia,
	S.A. Gardiner centers on the activities of Aerolineas Argentinas, an Argentina
	based corporation owned by Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espafia, S.A., a corporation
	owned by the Spanish government. Aerolineas' ownership structure is said to
	be "tiered," since Spain's ownership of Aerolineas Argentinas is indirect, i.e.
	mediated through an intermediate corporation in the form of Iberia Lineas Aereas
	de Espafia.</p>
